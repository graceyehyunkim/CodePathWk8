# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Fixation

Vulnerability #2: SQLi

Vulnerability #2: XSS

## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR

Vulnerability #2: CSRF


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work

CSRF has not been demonstrated in my class as of now. Red's second vulnerability is concluded upon process of elimination.
